Bank Ease — Console Based Banking System (Python OOP)

Bank Ease is a console-based banking application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
It simulates core banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, and transaction history — all through an interactive command-line interface.

This project demonstrates practical use of classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding in a real-world scenario.
